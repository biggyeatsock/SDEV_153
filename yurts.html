                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                        the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor,
                        a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                    <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size
                        bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and
                        chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your
                        luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and
                        cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                        located in the lodge.

                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                        dress for changing weather with light layers of
                        clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
                        sense of adventure!
